- Cinnamon desktop
- Unity desktop
- Generic X11 DE **(with `scrot`)**

#### Tested on
- Ubuntu 18.10

# How to Use
##### Twitter
**This is a temporary measure for connecting to Twitter and will be changed in the future**  
ShareXin uses the **Ruby** Twitter tool `t` for sending Tweets.  
For non-Flatpak users, you will need to manually install the tool.  
You don't need to directly interface with `t` in either Flatpak or Native, as ShareXin can call the tool directly for authenticating and tweeting.  

To authenticate to Twitter:  
`$ sharexin tweet auth`  
And on Flatpak:  
`$ flatpak run io.github.ShareXin tweet auth`
##### Mastodon
**This is a temporary measure for connecting to Mastodon and will be changed in the future**  
ShareXin uses the **Python** Mastodon tool `toot` for sending Toots.  
For non-Flatpak users, you will need to manually install the tool.  
You don't need to directly interface with `toot` in either Flatpak or Native, as ShareXin can call the tool directly for logging in and tooting.  

To login to your Mastodon instance:  
`$ sharexin toot auth`  
And on Flatpak:  
`$ flatpak run io.github.ShareXin toot auth`
##### Imgur
ShareXin uses its own API and App to upload to Imgur, so no external tool is necessary, and you do not need to setup your own API with Imgur to use it. **(if you do wish to change it, change [this line](https://github.com/ShareXin/ShareXin/blob/0c9bd4692a72e56eb8525cebed0e507321e7d341/src/imgur.rs#L30))**
##### Screenshotting
**Flatpak is currently limited to only GNOME**  
For users of the GNOME Desktop (X11/Wayland), you should already have `GNOME Screenshot` installed by default, so you do not need to worry.  
Unity, Budgie, and Cinnamon Desktop users are recommended to use `GNOME Screenshot` for the best experience, however none of these desktops have Wayland support, so any other tool mentioned can be used, such as `Spectacle` or `scrot`  
For users of the Plasma (X11/Wayland) Desktop, you should have `Spectacle` installed in order to have the best experience with ShareXin.  
For users of any X11 desktop, you must use `scrot` for screenshotting with ShareXin.
##### Keybinding
For GNOME Users, setup a custom keyboard shortcut in Settings, and if you want a custom keybinding (say to replace **Print Screen**), navigate to this Dconf setting to change a binding. `/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/`  
For Plasma Users, you do you.  
For any other desktop, you do you.
